Hi Jack,

A segmentation fault is the result of a memory access violation. The program has referred to a memory address outside of what was allocated to it, and the OS kernel responds by killing the program with SIGSEGV.
It is a good idea to include a backtrace of the events that led up to the seg fault.

Please run below commands for backtrace:

    enable core files: $ ulimit -c unlimited
    reproduce the crash: $ ./yourapp
    debug crash with gdb: $ gdb ./yourapp core

Check the call trace from GDB until the point where it receives segmentation fault.Please let me know if any more detials you need from my side.

Thanks,
Richa
