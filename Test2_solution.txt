Hi Sue,

Here clean will return you to a state where all you have is the "source" files. In other words, it gets rid of everything that can be built from something else (objects, executables, listings and so on).

So make clean ; make is expected to build everything from scratch. And, in fact, you'll often find a rule like:

rebuild: clean all

which will do both steps for you.

You should never have to do a clean unless you're wanting to (for example) copy just the source files somewhere. If you have to do so after editing a file, then your Makefile is not set up correctly.

And, if you make and get an error, you should get exactly the same error if you subsequently make without fixing said error.
